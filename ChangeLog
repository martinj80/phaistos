2013-04-29  Jan Valentin <janvalentin>

	* src/energy/term_angle.h Added. Provides an observable which dumps
	  angle data. In settings one can choose to dump all angle data or
	  only the data for the dihedral angels.

	* modules/applications/bin/calc_rmsd.cpp Updated. The options class
	  has been changed and it now supports the calculation of truncated
	  RMSD's.

2013-03-21  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* modules/trajectory/bin/trajectory_subset.cpp Added. Program for
	  extracting a subset from a trajectory file, either by specifying
	  an iteration range, or by weighted sampling (useful for
	  extracting a Boltzmann distributed ensemble from a generelized
	  ensemble).

	* modules/trajectory/src/protein/xtc_chain.h Minor optimizations.

	* modules/profasi/bin/phaistos_cpp/global_option_definitions.cpp
	   Removed clash-fast from profasi alias (in line with the
	   profasi-cached alias)

2013-03-12  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* modules/muninn/scripts/muninn_weights.py Added. This script
	allows you to add a column of muninn weights to an observable file.

	* scripts/plot_columns.py, scripts/plot_hist.py Input is now read
	as structured arrays, rather than normal arrays. This makes it
	possible to read in text fields and numeric fields in the same array.

2013-02-25  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* src/utils/program_option_parser.cpp After last parsing round,
	check whether there are partial matches among the unregistered
	options, and if so, send the unrecognized options along to this
	option in short format.

	* src/utils/program_options_short_format_parser.h Grammar for
	the short command line option format used in phaistos. Makes it
	possible to parse this format directly into a boost ptree.

	  for histograms_per_reinit changed to 0, meaning that muninn will
	  no longer reinitialize per default.

2013-01-11 Mikael Borg <borg>

	* */CMakeLists.txt Added directives for building binary packages
	  Depending on build host, make package can create rpm or deb packages.
	  Note that only executables, data files and manual are included in the

2012-10-29  Jan Valentin <janvalentin>

	* src/energy/term_backbone_dbn.h
	* bin/phaistos_option_definitions.h
	  The option eliminate-move-bias was added to the backbone-dbn energy for speed
	  efficiency in cases where the move bias should be divided out, when using dbn
	  moves.
	* src/moves/move_pivot_local.h
	* src/moves/move_priors.h
	  There was a bug in move-pivot-local which made backboneDBN out of sync.

	* src/protein/atom.cpp Added support for HD1,HD2 in ASP
	  and HE1,HE2 in GLU.

2012-10-22  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* modules/phaistos_cpp/bin/phaistos.cpp
	  The initial.pdb file that is dumped at the beginning of each simulation
	  is now dumped AFTER a call to monte_carlo->reinitialization, which
	  means that it will be clash free (unless declash_on_reinitialize=false).
	  Some programs, such as VMD, require a clash-free pdb structure in
	  order to correctly decode .xtc files.

2012-10-03  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	  boost::filesystem::filename() work both in boost < 1.46 and >= 1.46.

	* modules/phaistos_cpp/bin/phaistos.cpp Phaistos now dumps initial
	  conformation as a .pdb file. This makes it easier to work with .xtc
	  output, which requires a single .pdb file for conversions back to pdb.

2012-09-30  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* modules/phaistos_cpp/bin/phaistos.cpp Removed compactify procedure.

2012-09-30  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	  is not found.

	* modules/opls/bin/phaistos_cpp/includes.cpp Fixed opls-mc-dynamics mode specification
	  (sc -> sidechain)

	* * Updated Doxygen comments.

2012-06-26  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* src/moves/move.h (Move::Settings) Added weight as a setting attribute
	  for all moves.

	* src/moves/move_collection.h (MoveCollection::add_move()) Removed
	  weight parameter. The weight of a move is now set through the
	  settings object of the move itself.

	* bin/phaistos_option_definitions.h All calls to add_move() modified
	  to no longer explicitly set weight.

	* modules/crisp/bin/phaistos_cpp/global_definitions.cpp All calls to

	  making it possible to pass a file containing pdb filenames.

	* modules/pleiades/bin/pleiades_rmsd.cpp (get_all_pdb_files) Split
	  functionality into a get_pdb_files_from_directory() and a
	  get_pdb_files_from_file() function, to support new pdb-list-file option.

	* modules/pleiades/bin/pleiades_rmsd.cpp (random_shuffle) Added function
	  for shuffling an array. This is a generalized version which can also
	  deal with weighted samples.

	* modules/pleiades/src/cluster_rmsd.cpp (ClusterRmsd::get_median) Added
	  support for median evaluations using knowledge of current energies.

	* src/energy/term_rmsd.h (calc_rmsd_truncated) Merged with calc_rmsd
	  since they had the same functionality.

2012-04-23  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* modules/applications/bin/evaluate_observable.cpp Added functionality
	  for reading in weights as part of a pdb_list file (as a second column).
	  This means that reweighted averages can now be calculated using
	  observables. Currently, only contact map has been tested in this scenario.

	* src/energy/energy_term.h (EnergyTerm) Added extra_weight member
	  variable. This is an additional weight which can be modified
	  dynamically during a simulation, in contrast to the constant
	  weight in the settings object.

	* src/energy/energy_term.h (EnergyTerm::get_weight()) Added. Returns
	  product of constant settings weight and dynamics extra_weight.

	* src/energy/term_contact_map.h Added support for weighted contact
	  maps.

	* src/energy/observable_collection.h (ObservableCollection::evaluate())
	  Now called evaluate_weighted() on energy terms, rather than evaluate().
	  This means weights of energy terms are now taken into account in
	  observables as well.

	* src/energy/term_rmsd.h (TermRmsd) Changed type of reference_chain
	  from chain to chain pointer.

	* src/models/backbone_dbn/backbone_dbn.h (SettingsNodeCis) Added
          initialize_cis_from_pdb flag determining whether cis node should
	  be initialized when reading input from a PDB file.

	  calculates a burnin size based on the size of the current Muninn
	  simulation round, rather than the first simulation round.

	* modules/applications/bin/evaluate_observable.cpp Added same-ensemble
	  option, which will assume that all pdb-files are structures from the
	  same ensemble. This is faster and makes it possible to record statistics
	  in your observables (previously, a new observable collection was
	  constructed for each pdb file).

2012-01-04  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* src/energy/observable.h (Observable::observe) Added register_only
	  flag, to indicate that a call is used only for registration purposes, and

	  flag, to indicate that a call is used only for registration purposes, and
	  that the output will not be used.

	* src/energy/observable_collection.h Calls to Observable::observe() are now
	  passed a flag indicating whether result will be outputted or whether
	  the call is for registration only. This allows the author of an observable
	  to save some time in cases where no output is needed.

	* src/energy/contact_map.h Rewritten. Added observable making it
	  possible to monitor contact maps during the course of a
	  simulation.

	* src/energy/q_factor.h (TermQFactor) Class now inherits contact map
	  functionality from TermContactMapBase. This energy is now compatible

	  the original PDB string rather than an integer value.

2011-07-05  Wouter Boomsma  <wb>

	* bin/phaistos.cpp (initialize_chain) Refseq information is
	  now read from pdb file also when --init-from-pdb=false.

	* src/protein/protein_data.h (ProteinData::get_resseq) Added.

	* src/protein/chain_fb.h|chain_ca.h Added ref_seq parameter
	  to non-pdb constructors for cases where the chain is
	  not initialized from a pdb file, but where a pdb file is
	  available so resseq information can be extracted.
