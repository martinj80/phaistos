============================================================
PHAISTOS - INSTALL file
============================================================

This file contains instructions about compilation of the 
Phaistos library.

============
Requirements
============

Phaistos requires a working C++ compiler and Fortran compiler,
CMake version 2.6.2 or later, Boost version 1.41 or later and
Lapack/Blas. 

==================
Basic installation
==================

Change directory to the Phaistos directory. Create a build 
directory, call cmake and then make

% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make

Cmake takes a variety of options. For our purpose, the most
important is specification of a non-standard location of 
Boost and Lapack and Blas.

% cmake -DBOOST_ROOT:FILEPATH=XXX LAPACK_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=YYY BLAS_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=ZZZ ..

You can also choose beween compiling in Debug mode (without 
optimization and with debug information for debuggers), or in
Release mode. Release mode is default.

% cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

It is also possible to switch modules off and on. This is done using
-DPHAISTOS_MODULE_DISABLE and -DPHAISTOS_MODULE_ENABLE flags. Both
these options take a regular expression. For instance, you can turn
off the muninn module using

% cmake -DPHAISTOS_MODULE_DISABLE:STRING="muninn" ..


All cmake options and there current settings can be found using

% cmake -LA

See the manual for further details. The manual can be created in PDF format 
using:

% make manual_pdf 

You can find the PDF file in the doc directory.
