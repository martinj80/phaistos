\section{BASILISK}
\label{sec:basilisk}

BASILISK is a probabilistic model of the conformational space of 
amino acid side chains in proteins. Unlike rotamer libraries, 
BASILISK models the $\chi$-angles in continuous space, including 
the influence of the protein's backbone.

The BASILISK model and certain applications are incorporated into the
Phaistos framework, providing both a move (section
\ref{sec:basilisk-move}) and an energy term (section
\ref{sec:basilisk-energy}). If you are interested in the model itself
and its applications outside the Phaistos framework, we refer to the
separately released software package:

\section{COMPAS}
\label{sec:compas}

COMPAS models protein sidechains using a coarse-grained
representation. Each sidechain is represented using a single pseudo
atom, parameterized using a set of angles and a distance.  As for the
BASILISK model, the COMPAS model is available both as a move (section
\ref{sec:compas-move}) and an energy term (section
\ref{sec:compas-energy}). The model is described in some detail in a
recent paper on simulations under SAXS restraints
\cite{stovgaard2011}.
