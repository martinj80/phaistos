\section{XTC trajectory (\texttt{xtc-trajectory})}
\label{sec:observable-xtc-trajectory}

Dumping structural states as PDB files can be quite space
consuming. As an alternative, PHAISTOS includes support for dumping
structural states in Gromacs' XTC file format. The default output file
for this observable is \texttt{trajectory\_\%p\_\%t.xtc}, where
\texttt{\%p} and and \texttt{\%t} are replaced by the process id and
thread number, respectively.
