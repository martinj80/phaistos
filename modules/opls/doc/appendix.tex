\section{Testing OPLS (\texttt{test\_opls.cpp})}

The OPLS module features a test\_opls program to test and profile the
energy terms. In \verb|/opls/test/CMakeLists.txt| there is a line that
adds the \verb|-pg| tag when uncommented. It is intended for expert
users only.

It is build in the following way:
\begin{verbatim}
phaistos/build$ make test_opls
phaistos/build$ cd test
phaistos/build/test$ ./test_opls 2gb1.pdb
\end{verbatim}
